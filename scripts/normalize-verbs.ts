/**
 * Normalizes the leading verb of a generated tool name onto a consistent
 * verb_noun convention.
 *
 * Procore's operation titles use whatever verb the doc author reached for --
 * "List RFIs", "Show RFI", "Get All Equipment", "Retrieve Note", "Fetch
 * Attachment" -- so the generated surface mixed list/get/show/return/
 * retrieve/fetch for what are, semantically, two operations: read-many and
 * read-one. Agents pick tools by name, and a surface where the same action
 * wears six different verbs makes that guesswork.
 *
 * Two rules, both meaning-preserving:
 *
 *   1. READS (GET only). Any of the read synonyms collapses to `list_` when
 *      the endpoint genuinely returns a collection and `get_` when it does
 *      not. The verdict comes from `returnsCollection` -- the same
 *      schema-derived signal the description uses -- so the name is correct
 *      by construction rather than inherited from prose. This also repairs
 *      names that were already actively wrong (a `list_*` tool returning one
 *      record, a `get_all_*` tool returning a collection).
 *
 *   2. THIRD PERSON -> IMPERATIVE. "Creates"/"Updates"/"Deletes" are the same
 *      verb as "Create"/"Update"/"Delete", just conjugated differently by the
 *      doc author. And on a DELETE, "destroy" is a plain synonym of "delete".
 *
 * Everything else is left alone on purpose. A verb that names a DISTINCT
 * action -- reorder, recycle, restore, sync, send, export, close, approve,
 * assign, add/remove (association semantics), and the rest -- must survive,
 * because four prior releases went into making sure a tool's name never
 * claims semantics its endpoint does not have. Forcing `reorder_company_role`
 * to `create_company_role` for the sake of a uniform prefix would reintroduce
 * exactly that bug.
